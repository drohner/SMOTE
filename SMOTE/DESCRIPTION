Description: In this package three algorithms for oversampling are implemented. These are SMOTE (Synthetic minority over-sampling technique), Safe-Level-SMOTE and Local Neighbourhood SMOTE (LNSMOTE). For these procedures the k nearest neighbors have to be computed. Therefore, a method wrapping several C++ libraries providing this functionality is implemented.
